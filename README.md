PROCESS
- set up node express proj using procedural base code [hw1 terrain]
- checked that code works on both windows + mac!
- using plane geometry & shader code, set up a visible grid system for the ocean
- implement basic gerstner wave model from tessendorf/liao papers and displace vertices of ocean grid
- following the gerstner model, layer multiple waves on top of each other to achieve a more complex effect
- worley noise in fragment shader for texture
- sine displacement added for basic animation of worley texture
- WASD keyboard controls for basic movement
